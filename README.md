# gitutil

Small package to quickly switch between many git accounts on one computer.

## How to use

* Get the binary file

* Best way - create an alias for your favourite shell to call the binary from whenever you are

* copy `setup.yaml` to your `~`

* provide your `main` and `work` setup to `setup.yaml`

* run by `./gitutil <account>` where `<account>` is either your `main` or `work` (just type that)
